mima-html-js
============
I think it is safe to say that at some point in your coding career you will find that you have to mix html with your javascript. Mixing one or two lines of html with your code probably will not present much of a problem, but what if you need to output large chunks of html such as dynamic form when your users click a button or a certain event occurs? 

It's for that kind of occassion I created mimahtml, which is a small javascript file containing numerous functions to cleanly output pretty much any html element you can think of. For tutorials on how to use the file please visit my website http://mimasoftware.com.
